## Why is this learning path important

Applications and software engineering techniques have never evolved at such a quick pace as today. New frameworks, practices, and technologies keep emerging while bringing new concepts and increased complexity of software. As a result, it feels hard to keep up with change and make the right choices along your end-to-end modern application lifecycle.

Beyond technology, this learning path will teach you the fundamentals of the 30+ years old [VMware Tanzu Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) methodology to develop modern applications:

- Build the right thing the first time.
- Use agile development to deliver the products your customers want.
- Seed a new mindset quickly validating your concepts and get them from idea to production in days, not months.

## Who is this for

This learning path primarily targets software engineers and other technical development team members involved in the development of modern applications. Managers, designers, and other non-technical stakeholders may find it helpful to understand the vocabulary, but the skills here will center on technical prerequisites needed to build modern software.


## What you will learn

You will learn everything needed to start as a newly onboarded team member. It is also meant as an adequate on-the-clock preparation to get the most of an on-site or remote lab engagement.

<!-- Going through the content should only take a about  -->

Each section of this learning path provides context to the skills or technologies in question with links throughout to specific and targeted info you will need.
